            <br><br><br><br>ðŸ’œThe very first time I saw you, the feeling I got was something I never want to lose.
            Itâ€™s a feeling I want to hold on to for the rest of my life.I truly believe this is something so close to
            your heart, just like it is to mine. I still canâ€™t find the right words to express how much I like you.
            Itâ€™s only been 4 months since we started talking, but it feels like we've known each other forever, and I
            know you feel it too.
            No matter what, even if something bigger than what we've faced in the past 10 days comes our way, Iâ€™ll
            always come back to you.ðŸ’œ<br><br>
            ðŸ’œRight now, nothing major is happening in my life (I am not perfect), this is just my current situation...
            but I know it won't stay like this forever, and only I truly understand that.
            Iâ€™m sharing this because, somehow, I feel like Iâ€™m not able to fully be with you, and I just want to.
            I hope that when youâ€™re with me, we can manage everything together, no matter what life throws our way.
            I really feel like I can take care of you, keep you happy, and be everything you need.
            But, I want you to tell me that too.
            Iâ€™m waiting for your response...ðŸ’œ
